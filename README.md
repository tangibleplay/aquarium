Tangible Play Game Engineer Coding Test
===
Unity Version 2019.2.0f1
===

A game engineers chief responsibility at Osmo is *creating delight* and that's the ask of the aquarium test. Ideally when you're done you'll have something fun to play with. You may need to consult your inner 5 year old. Might I suggest starting with adding some fish.

It's intentionally a very open ended test and we encourage you to apply **your** strengths. Into AI? Give the fish small fish-sized brains. Love shaders? I'd love some compelling water and effects. Audiophile? Should be easy to improve on no sound whatsoever. UI/UX? Wouldn't it be cool if you could interact somehow?

I don't recommend spending more than a work day on it (maybe two if you get carried away). I've included some basic assets so you so that you don't need to search around for some fish. You can absolutely use any version of Unity 2019, I apologize if you have to download it, I know that's obnoxious.

When we play your aquarium, we'll be looking for the following things:
1. creativity
2. legibility of your code
3. good unity habits
4. optimization skills (use the right data structures, don't do terrible things)

But mostly, we're looking for you to have some fun with it. 

Please feel free to give me tips for things you might like added to the test library for bonus points. Thank you for your interest in Osmo, and good luck! We sincerely hope you find your dream job.
